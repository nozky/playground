This is my first project in java way back. I mean like way back... :)

Now, I remake it using javascript, html and css.
Ignore the drawings, codes, basically everything!

Excuse my drawings, I really try to make it more realistic as you can see.

Enjoy playing...

>Note: Im using fetch to get a word from API somewhere...
